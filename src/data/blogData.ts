        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-5">What Makes Corten Steel Unique for Outdoor Sculptures</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Corten steel (also known as weathering steel) has become increasingly popular in contemporary sculpture due to its distinctive appearance and practical benefits. This specialized alloy develops a stable rust-like patina when exposed to weather conditions, creating a natural protective layer with a rich, warm coloration.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Unlike traditional steel that deteriorates with rust, Corten's oxidation process is self-limiting and protective. This unique characteristic allows sculptors to create works that evolve visually over time while maintaining structural integrity for decades.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">According to metallurgical research, Corten steel can maintain its structural properties for 40-120 years in most environments, making it an excellent choice for permanent outdoor installations.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold md:font-semibold mb-5">Understanding Corten Steel and Its Properties</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600">Corten steel develops a distinctive protective rust layer that resists corrosion. It's popular in architecture and public art due to its ability to age naturally while maintaining structural integrity. This weathering process creates a living finish that adapts to environmental conditions, offering both durability and beauty.</p>
    <img class="mb-5" src="/images/blog/1-2.webp" alt="Corten Steel Overview">
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-10">Its composition includes copper, chromium, and nickel, all of which contribute to its weather-resistance. However, this also means that special care is needed during cleaning to avoid disrupting the protective surface.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5">Key Benefits of Corten Steel</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-10">
        <li class="mb-2">Strong resistance to corrosion in most environments</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Formation of a self-healing patina that protects over time</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Minimal upkeep requirements compared to painted steel</li>
        <li>Long-lasting performance in outdoor installations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-5">How the Patina Forms</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600">The rust-like patina forms naturally as Corten steel is exposed to the atmosphere. This process protects the steel underneath from further corrosion. Cleaning should never remove this layer, but instead enhance its preservation. When necessary, light brushing or rinsing with a pH-neutral solution helps maintain the steel’s intended finish.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-600">In environments with high pollution or humidity, monitoring for uneven weathering and early buildup is essential. Proper care ensures consistent oxidation and a uniform appearance over time.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8" style="font-family: Montserrat">What is Corten Steel & Why Does It Rust?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6" style="font-family: Montserrat; line-height: 1.8">
              Corten steel, also known as weathering steel, is an alloy designed to form a stable rust-like appearance after exposure to the elements. Unlike standard steel, which deteriorates over time, Corten steel develops a protective outer layer that prevents further corrosion. This makes it a popular choice for sculptures, architecture, and outdoor installations.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">The natural oxidation process can take months or years depending on environmental conditions. While it requires minimal upkeep, certain factors such as pollution, salt exposure, and high humidity can accelerate wear.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Environmental Factors That Affect Corten Steel</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Rain, humidity, air pollution, and saltwater can impact the weathering process of Corten steel. If placed in areas with high moisture levels or near coastal regions, the rust layer may not stabilize properly, leading to excessive degradation. Proper placement and routine maintenance can mitigate these issues.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Should You Seal Corten Steel? (Pros & Cons)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Applying a sealant to Corten steel is a debated topic. While sealing can slow down the oxidation process and prevent rust stains on nearby surfaces, it can also trap moisture underneath, leading to inconsistent patina development. In dry climates, leaving the steel untreated may be the best option, but in humid or coastal environments, a breathable sealant may provide protection.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Routine Inspection Checklist for Longevity</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Regular inspections help identify potential problem areas early. Look for signs of excessive rust build-up, structural weaknesses, or moisture accumulation. A bi-annual checkup can ensure the sculpture remains in optimal condition.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">General Cleaning Guidelines</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">To clean Corten steel, use mild detergents and a soft brush. Avoid high-pressure washing or harsh chemicals that can strip away the protective layer. Dust and debris can be removed using a dry cloth, while mild soapy water can be used for tougher stains.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">How to Repair Scratches & Restore Rust Finish</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Minor scratches or discoloration can be remedied by lightly sanding the affected area and allowing it to re-oxidize naturally. In cases where deep scratches expose fresh steel, misting the surface with a saltwater solution can help accelerate the patina formation process.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Using the Wrong Cleaning Chemicals</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Avoid acidic cleaners or abrasive pads, as they can damage the surface and disrupt the protective layer. Opt for pH-neutral soaps and soft cloths for safe cleaning.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Over-Sealing (Why Less is More with Corten Steel)</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Excessive sealing can lead to uneven oxidation patterns and may cause long-term durability issues. If sealing is necessary, use a breathable product designed for weathering steel.</p>
